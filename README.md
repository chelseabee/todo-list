# todo-list

I built my first JavaScript heavy app on my own. I have built things with specific tutorials before, but I really wanted to achieve this and come up with the logic on my own, and I did! 

There are a couple of things that are a bit buggy that I want to work out, the main one being that I need to find out how to re-assign the task numbers when a task is deleted. 

Overall the app works really well, and it is just how I envisioned.
